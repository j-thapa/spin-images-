# **2D Spin Image Generation from 3D Point Cloud Meshes**
This repository contains Python code for generating **spin images** from **3D point cloud meshes**.

## **Overview**
Spin images provide a robust representation for **3D surface matching** by capturing geometric information around a point in a 2D image-like format. This script processes a given **3D point cloud** and generates **spin images** for analysis and matching.

## **Example**
When a **point cloud** of an object, such as the **basin** shown below, is provided, the script **segments the point cloud into three chunks** and generates the corresponding **spin images** as output.

### **Input Point Cloud**

### **Generated Spin Images**

## **Implementation Details**
- The script is **well-commented**, explaining the inner workings of the **functions and algorithms** used.
- The methodology follows the principles outlined in **Andrew Johnsonâ€™s research on Spin-Images for 3D surface matching**.

## **Reference**
This implementation is based on the paper:
